This is a simple script to automatically upload your local backups to GCP for cheap offsite storage. This should be much cheaper than buying for a high storage Google Drive subscription for these uploads. When you make your bucket, select cold storage for the cheapest options. Note, however, that retrieving the data will cost you so it's best to just have as a last resort backup

The notes for what needs to be modified for your setup are in the UploadToGCP.py file
